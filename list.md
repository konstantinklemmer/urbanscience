**About the list:** *The purpose of this list is to have a curated collection of publishing outlets for the inter- and multidisciplinary field broadly described as "Urban Science". We use several (sub)categories and tags to create a somewhat coherent structure. If you have any ideas on how to improve the structure, please let us know by raising an [issue](https://github.com/konstantinklemmer/urbanscience/issues).*

## Urban Economics
Urban economics is broadly the economic study of urban areas; as such, it involves using the tools of economics to analyze urban issues such as crime, education, public transit, housing, and local government finance. More narrowly, it is a branch of microeconomics that studies urban spatial structure and the location of households and firms ([Quigley 2008](http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_U000035&edition=current&q=Urban%20economics&topicid=&result_number=1)).

## Urban Studies
Urban studies is based on the study of the urban development of cities. This includes studying the history of city development from an architectural point of view, to the impact of urban design on community development efforts. Urban studies helps with the understanding of human values, development, and the interactions they have with their physical environment ([Flora & Flora 2007](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/unf_research/48/)).

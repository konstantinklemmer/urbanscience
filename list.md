**About the list:** *The purpose of this list is to have a curated collection of publishing outlets for the inter- and multidisciplinary field broadly described as "Urban Science". We use several (sub)categories and tags to create a somewhat coherent structure. If you have any ideas on how to improve the structure, please let us know by raising an [issue](https://github.com/konstantinklemmer/urbanscience/issues).*

## Urban Economics
Urban economics is broadly the economic study of urban areas; as such, it involves using the tools of economics to analyze urban issues such as crime, education, public transit, housing, and local government finance. More narrowly, it is a branch of microeconomics that studies urban spatial structure and the location of households and firms ([Quigley 2008](http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_U000035&edition=current&q=Urban%20economics&topicid=&result_number=1)).

## Urban Studies
Urban studies is based on the study of the urban development of cities. This includes studying the history of city development from an architectural point of view, to the impact of urban design on community development efforts. Urban studies helps with the understanding of human values, development, and the interactions they have with their physical environment ([Flora & Flora 2007](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/unf_research/48/)).

## Smart Cities
A smart city is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently. The smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the network (the Internet of things or IoT) to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving ([Wikipedia 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city)).
